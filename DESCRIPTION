Description: Helpers for addressing the issue of disconnected spatial units. 
    It allows for convenient adding and removal of neighbourhood connectivity between areal units prior to modelling, with the visual aid of maps.
    Post-modelling, it reduces the human workload for extracting, tidying and mapping predictions from areal models.
